  My Python tutorial contains the following fragment, which is enclosed in triple quotes below:
  
  ```
  {fragment}
  ```
  
  I just got this feedback about that particular fragment, also enclosed in triple quotes below, from a reviewer:
  
  ```
  {feedback}
  ```
  
  Can you make the requested changes to that fragment, please? Alternatively, you may push back if there's a legitimate reason.
